"""
You've uncovered a secret alien language. To your surpise, the language is made
up of all English lowercase letters. However, the alphabet is possibly in a
different order (but is some permutation of English lowercase letters).

You need to write a function that, given a sequence of words written in this
secret language, and the order the alphabet, will determine if the given words
are sorted "alphabetically" in this secret language.

The function will return a boolean value, true if the given words are sorted
"alphabetically" (based on the supplied alphabet), and false if they are not
sorted "alphabetically".

Example 1:
{
    0: 'h',
    1: 'l',
    2: 'a',
    ...
    18: 's',
}
```plaintext
Input: words = ["lambda","school"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'l' comes before 's' in this language, then the sequence is
sorted.
```
{
    'h': 0,
    'a': 1
    ...
    'e': 5,
    ...
    's': 18,
    'w': 22,
}
Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: words = ["were","where","yellow"], order = "habcdefgijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'e' comes after 'h' in this language, then words[0] > words[1],
hence the sequence is unsorted.
```

Example 3:

```plaintext
Input: words = ["lambda","lamb"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: The first four characters "lamb" match, and the second string is
shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "lambda" > "lamb",
because 'd' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less
than any other character (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order).
```

Notes:

- order.length == 26
- All characters in words[i] and order are English lowercase letters.
