# Data Structures and Algorithms III - Hash Tables I

`This is the starter code for Computer Science - Sprint 4: Data Structures and Algorithms III - Hash Tables I.`




## Dictionaries, Objects, Associative Arrays 

- Key-value pairs or assocications
- Count all of the occurences of chars in a string 

 `var num_a = 11`

 `var num_b = 2` 
-> Static

## Properties 

- Efficient look-up of values using keys: O(1)

- ` Not efficient at finding key given a value: O(n)`

- Insertion/Removal of key-value pairs: O(1)

- ` Generally, do not keep track of the order of key-value pairs(Python dictionaries are an exception)`
